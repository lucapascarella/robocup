## Project Description

### Project: Virtual Soccer

- Goal: Design you own algorithm for playing soccer implementing a finite state machine that defines the robot behavior
- Example
  - Behavior: Shoot the ball when the ball is near
  - States: Find Ball, Track Ball, Shoot Ball
  - Code

```python
class YourPlayer(Player):
    FIND_BALL = 0
    TRACK_BALL = 1
    SHOOT_BALL = 2

    def behave(self):
        state = FIND_BALL # initial state

        while True:
            if state == self.FIND_BALL:
                # Ball detection

            elif state == self.TRACK_BALL:
                # Ball tracking

            elif state == self.SHOOT_BALL:
                self.move("Shoot")
                state = TRACK_BALL # state transition

        return
```
